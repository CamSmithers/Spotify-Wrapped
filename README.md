# Spotify Wrapped Using R
This project was designed to emulate Spotify Wrapped using R. In this project I wanted to identify the followingâ€¦
1. 10 Artists/Albums/Songs for Each Year
2. Play Count for Favorite Artists/Albums/Songs
3. 10 Artists/Albums/Songs Over the Course of Each Year
4. 10 Artists/Albums/Songs Over Time (All-Time Using Spotify)
5. Which songs I listened to the most when having great days or horrible days
